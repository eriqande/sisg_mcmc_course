{\color{section0}Dr. Eric C. Anderson\\
NOAA - Southwest Fisheries Science Center, Santa Cruz, CA\\
Research Associate, Department of Applied Math \& Statistics, UCSC}

Eric develops methods for the analysis of genetic data from populations of salmon and other organisms.  He has developed approaches using MCMC and other Monte Carlo methods for estimating $N_e$, classifying species hybrids, the inference of pedigrees, and analysis of massively parallel sequencing data.

{\color{section0}Dr. Matthew Stephens\\
Professor, Department of Human Genetics and\\
Department of Statistics, The University of Chicago}	

Matthew Stephens develops methods for the analysis of genetic data in humans and other species. He has, among other applications, developed MCMC methods to estimate population structure, rates of recombination, missing genotypes, and haplotype phase from genotypes on unrelated individuals.

% {\color{section0}Dr. Matthew Robinson \\
% Assistant Professor, Complex Trait Genetics Group\\
% Department of Computational Biology \\
% University of Lausanne, Switzerland}
%   
% Matthew Robinson began working on evolutionary genetics in wild populations and then changed fields to human 
% medical genetics.  His research areas include 
% prediction of disease risk in personalised medicine, the genetics of aging,
% genotype-environment interactions, the role of selection in shaping human
% population differentiation, and assortative mating of human populations.
